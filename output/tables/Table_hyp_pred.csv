Hypothesis,Prediction,Population,Viusal System,Background
Relaxed predation pressure results in character (colour signal) release,Display colouration used in male-male contests and courtship will be more conspicuous to a conspecific in Hawaii than Kenya.,Hawaii,chamleleon,Hawaii
,,Kenya,chamleleon,Kenya
,"Kenya chameleons should be more camouflaged in response to bird and snake predator stimuli than Hawaiian chameleons because Kenya has more chameleon predators. Conversely, if Kenyan chameleons are more camouflaged, then Hawaiian chameleons will be more conspicuous.",Hawaii,snake/bird,Hawaii

Local adaptation,Display coloration in the Hawaiian population is more conspicuous in its own signaling environment compared to the Kenyan population’s signaling environment.,Hawaii,chamleleon,Hawaii
,"Note, the same would be true for Kenyan chameleons but we did not include this analysis because we were only concerned with signal evolution in the invasive, Hawaiian, population.",Hawaii,chamleleon,Kenya
